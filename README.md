**Note:** This project was developed entirely on a smartphone due to the absence of a PC, I utilized inline React, importing libraries, and even Firebase as a CDN without traditional installations, akin to inline development. The frontend and backend were crafted using my smartphone, taking a total of 6 days to complete.Please keep in mind that this approach might not reflect standard development practices and is solely for demonstration purposes, Despite the challenges, I managed to create a full-stack web application, implementing features such as authentication, real-time feedback, and seamless navigation.

Happy coding!
